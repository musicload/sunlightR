# Overview
This is an overview document for all R projects (in the context of Sunlight).
As of now, the following projects and/or files exist here:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <- list.files(path = ".", recursive = F, include.dirs = T)
dim(x) <- c(length(x),1)
x
```

## Technical remains from R Markdown - just for fun
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(speed, dist, data=cars) + geom_smooth()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
