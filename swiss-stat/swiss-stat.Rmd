# Swiss Stats
This is an overview document for the Swiss Stats project (in the context of Sunlight).
The idea of this project is quite simple:

* learn and practice the R basics
    + Getting the data from Internet
    + Data cleansing
    + Reproducible research using Open Data sources
    + Basic visualizations, plots and statistical calculations
* write simple functions and collaborate with others
    + push the contents to GitHub
    + write the functions to calculate quantiles, join data, show correlations etc.
    + collaborate with others with forks and pull requests (via GitHub)

# Technical remains
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(speed, dist, data=cars) + geom_smooth()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
